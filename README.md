The Jupyter Notebook, titled "19_Autonomous_Market_Analyst_Building_AI_Agents_for_Deep_Research.ipynb," provides a step-by-step guide to creating an autonomous market analyst using a multi-agent AI system.
The notebook begins by installing the necessary libraries, crewai and crewai[tools], which are frameworks for orchestrating autonomous AI agents. It then sets up the required API keys for 'SERPER_API_KEY' and 'OPENAI_API_KEY'.
The core of the notebook is the creation of a "crew" of AI agents, each with a specific role, goal, and backstory. The agents defined are:
	•	Market Researcher: This agent's goal is to find the three most relevant and impactful AI tools and trends. It is equipped with a "Search the internet with Serper" tool, enabling it to perform real-time, up-to-date searches.
	•	Content Strategist: This agent's goal is to narrate a compelling story about the future of AI by synthesizing the research findings.
The notebook then defines the tasks for these agents:
	1	Task 1 (for the Market Researcher): To research and find the top 3 most relevant AI tools and trends, focusing on their impact and relevance.
	2	Task 2 (for the Content Strategist): To compile the research findings into a blog post of at least 4 paragraphs, written in a narrative format.
Finally, the notebook instantiates the Crew with the defined agents and tasks and kicks off the process. The output shows the agents' thought processes and actions as they execute their tasks. The Market Researcher performs a search and identifies key AI trends, which the Content Strategist then uses to generate a blog post. The final output of the notebook is the generated blog post, which is then saved to a file named "blog_post.md".
